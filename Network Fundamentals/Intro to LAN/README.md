# Intro to LAN (Local Area Network)

## Task1: Introducing LAN Topologies

- LAN stand for : **Local Area Network**

- The verb given to the job that Routers perform is : **routing**

- The device used to centrally connect multiple devices on the local network is : a **switch**

- The topology who's cost-efficient to set up is : ** Bus topology**

- What topology is expensive to set up and maintain: **Star Topology** 

- For the Ring Topology: just cut a wire
  For the Bus Topology: Send a lot of packet from computer1 to computer5 and the network will down
  For the Star Topology: Just break the Router
at the end, the flag is : **THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}**

## Task2: A primer on Subnetting

- The technical term for dividing a network into smaller pieces is : **Subnetting**

- There is **32** bits in a subnet mask

- The range of a section of a subnet mask is: **0-255**

- The address used to identify the start of a network is : **Network Address*

- The address used to identify devices within a network is : **Host address**

- The name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another netwowrk is: **Default Gateway**


## Task3: The ARP Protocol:

- ARP stand for: **Address Resolution Protocol**

- The category of ARP packet who ask a device is : ARP **Request**

- The address who's used as a physical identifier for a device on a network is : **MAC Address**

- The address who's used as a logical identifier for a device on a network is : **IP address**

## Task4: The DHCP Protocol:

- To retrieve an IP address its the : **DHCP Discover** packet who's used

- The type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server is :**DHCP Request**

- The last DHCP Packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP Server is : **DHCP ACK**
